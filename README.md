# Projects-Samples

- This repository contains sample of python codes
- All python codes were written using ipython Notebook (.ipynb)
- Each case study contains one or more .csv or .xlms files that have to be downloaded with the ipynb file to the user's default home directory. This is necessary for those files to be successfully imported. Alternatively, the path for those data files can be changed in the code
- Projects folders could include other files such as presentation(pptx) files, reports, and visualization files (html)
