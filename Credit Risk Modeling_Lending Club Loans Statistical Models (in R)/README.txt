Instructions for running codes:

1. Go to the folder “Step1 - Feature Engineering - Added Variables”. The Zip Codes and Rent handling information lie therein. Run “PrepareRentsByZip.py” using a python environment.

This will generate a file called Zip3Rents.csv. Which is already included in Step2 folder.

2. Go to “Step2 - Raw Data and Cleansing R Code” folder. Run the code TidyData.R file (uses raw data file that is already in the folder). Generates LC_data.

3. Go to “Step3 - Statistical Models” folder, and run Analysis.R (uses LC_data as an input).

4. Go to “Step4 - Python Visualization Code” folder for visualization results.
